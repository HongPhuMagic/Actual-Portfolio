      <description>ML-Project-3-Exoplanets Conclusion I used my best two models to classify the candidates!
 SVC predicted there would be 994 potential earth-sized and smaller within the habitable zone! Random Forest prediced there would be 829 potential earthh-sized and smaller within the habitable zone!  Models and their final performance was;
 Logistic Regression (87%) KNN (86%) Decision Tree (84%) Random Forest (89%) SVM (90%)  Project Goal The goal of this project is to predict potential Exoplanets that are earth-size and smaller within the habitable zone of their respective sun using a variety of classification models.</description>

      <description>ML-Project-3-Bitcoin Conclusion I completed my RNN model to predict bitcoin prices! However, the performance was poor which could be due to many reasons. So it&amp;rsquo;s clear that this model wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to forecast bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s price and this was expected. As the model tries to forecast further into the future, the errors that it may picked up while trying to forecasting will be magnified the further we try to forecast because the model will be forecasting the forecast.</description>

      <description>ML-Project-2-Drug-sales Conclusion The following final models used on the test dataset, N02BA, and their RMSE and R2 respectively are:
 Linear Regression (RMSE: 36.53, R2: 0.076) Polynomial Regression (RMSE: 38.13, R2: -0.007) Gradient boosting (RMSE: 45.73, R2: -0.448)  With Linear regression (54% accuracy), polynomial regression, and gradient boosting (99% accuracy) as the best three performing models.
Project Goal The goal for this project was to build regression models that can be used to predict future drug sales of:</description>
