      <description>ML-Project-4-Exoplanets Project Goal The goal of this project was to predict potential exoplanets that are earth-sized and smaller within the habitable zone of their respective sun using a variety of classification models.
Conclusion After extracting 2418 candidates, I used my best two models to classify them.
 SVC predicted there would be 994 potential earth-sized and smaller exoplanets within the habitable zone Random Forest predicted there would be 829 potential earth-sized and smaller exoplanets within the habitable zone  If I was part of NASA&amp;rsquo;s team that is involved in the Kepler&amp;rsquo;s mission, I would attempt to validate the candidates my models predicted.</description>

      <description>ML-Project-3-Bitcoin Project Goal The goal of this project was to predict bitcoin (btc) prices using ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average), a form of linear model, and RNN. One thing to note is that; bitcoin is known to be very manipulated so I did not expect my model to perform well.
Conclusion I have completed my RNN model to predict bitcoin prices. However, the performance was poor which could be due to many reasons.</description>

      <description>ML-Project-2-Drug-Sales Project Goal The goal for this project was to predict future classes of drug sales for the following:
  N02BA - Analgesics and Antipyretics, Salicylic Acid and derivatives
  N05B - Psycholeptics drugs, Anxiolytic drugs
  Conclusion I would not rely on the final models built to predict drug sales for the classes of drugs I was interested in. I used five different regression models and selected the best three performing models using the results from the cross validation function.</description>
