      <description>ML-Project-3-Exoplanets Conclusion I used my best two models to classify the candidates!
 SVC predicted there would be 994 potential earth-sized and smaller within the habitable zone! Random Forest prediced there would be 829 potential earthh-sized and smaller within the habitable zone!  Models and their final performance was;
 Logistic Regression (87%) KNN (86%) Decision Tree (84%) Random Forest (89%) SVM (90%)  Project Goal The goal of this project is to predict potential Exoplanets that are earth-size and smaller within the habitable zone of their respective sun using a variety of classification models.</description>

      <description>ML-Project-2-Bitcoin Conclusion I have yet to reach to a conclusion due to my limited knowledge of ARIMA. I plan on eventually finishing this project as soon as I have gain more knowledge. I however, finished using rNN as an alternative model to predict bitcoin prices!
Project Goal The goal of this project is to predict bitcoin (btc) prices using ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average), a form of linear model, and rNN.</description>
